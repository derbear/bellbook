 * student is taking WHAP next year
	+ student goes to add.php to add WHAP as a course
	+ bellbook goes to bellbook.db.php to add books required for WHAP
	+ add.php now shows a bunch of books needed for WHAP
	+ student already has World Civilizations so he removes that book
	+ student enters in price and description for each book

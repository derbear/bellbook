TODO:

Implement all basic functionality | see 2.0 non experimental.
	- including supporting different editions for booksâ€¦ hmmmm
	- perhaps change $_POST[] and $_GET[]s into Yii::app()->requests.
User experience | brand new, simpler, better user interface that doesn't make one think.
	- transactions: require more interaction. People should be able to post a sell offer and get actual feedback and the such on it. Require buyers to submit a buy offer ("I want to buy this! For this alternate price") and the seller to confirm it, and provide instructions for exchange.
	- discussion: encourage lots and lots of discussion, and price haggling, and multiple offers on one book, and the ability to see what other people are offering.
	- maybe an even copy book info from amazon thing, to make it nice and easy
Social User | remember, bellbook is all about the user, without users this project goes nowhere.
	- implement Friends
	- implement Suggestions (what friends are selling, what courses you are in, what books you want)
	- implement Facebook Connect so people don't have to insert all their friends
Security and Bug Fixes | always important.
Marketing/Outreach | get students into this.
Recruitment and Organization | get more Bells involved in making Bellbook, testing, programming, designing, etc.
	
Goal | Bellbook makes it easier to exchange/sell books between you and your friends and the rest of the Bellarmine community. Because most students don't usually bring up next year's course books in a conversation (I mean, who would?) this service would make it easy for parents and students alike.
